            <p>
                A tech enthusiast with a strong focus on software development and CAD design. I’ve developed a 3D
                printer head and used CAD to design functional components like gears and bearings. With a passion for
                creating efficient solutions, I enjoy combining my technical expertise in programming and design to
                tackle complex projects. Whether it's automating processes or designing custom parts, I’m always looking
                for ways to innovate and improve.

                    <h3>Remote - Szeiner software company</h3>
                    <p>During my time at Szeiner Software Company, I worked as a Solo Developer, focusing on the
                        development
                        of
                        a multiplayer card game using the company's in-house multiplayer framework. I was responsible
                        for
                        designing and implementing various game mechanics and features. However, the project faced a
                        significant
                        setback when the author of the game rules withdrew from the project, leaving me with code for a
                        game
                        I
                        didn't have the rights to. Despite this challenge, I gained valuable experience in game
                        development
                        and
                        honed my skills in programming and problem-solving while navigating the complexities of working
                        within a
                        proprietary framework.</p>
